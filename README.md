# Firefox Browser Architecture

## Vision

Build the world’s best web browser

## Strategy

Our top priority is to plan for where we want to go, but if we just think 5 years out, we’ll miss the dragon on the doorstep. So we need to look from both angles:

1. Look forward from where we are now: Move faster
2. Look backwards from where we want to get to: Consciously plan our architecture

## Our Conclusions

* [Documenting our output](text/0001-documenting-output.md) looks at how we’re going to communicate with the rest of Mozilla.
* [Extracting Necko](text/0002-extracting-necko.md) considers whether it's feasible or worthwhile to extract Necko — Gecko's C++ networking library — for use as a standalone component.

## Posts

* [Browser Architecture Update](posts/2017-07-27-browser-architecture-update.md) is the first of our newsletters, sent to [firefox-dev](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/firefox-dev/) to keep everyone in the loop.
