# Firefox Browser Architecture

## Vision

Build the world’s best web browser

## Strategy

Our top priority is to plan for where we want to go, but if we just think 5 years out, we’ll miss the dragon on the doorstep. So we need to look from both angles:

1. Look forward from where we are now: Move faster
2. Look backwards from where we want to get to: Consciously plan our architecture
