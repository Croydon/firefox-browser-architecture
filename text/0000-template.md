# Documentation Template

## Problem

A short lay summary of the problem space and the stakeholders.

Our documents should have a front matter containing a title, which should be
the same as the first heading (using `#`).
Other headings will generally be at the `##` or `###` levels.


## Proposal

Explanation of the solution to the problem.


## Drawbacks / Unresolved Questions

It's a rare proposal that perfectly meets the problem, so we'll probably need
to document the drawbacks.


## Alternatives

Competitive analysis suggesting alternatives, costs, and opportunities.


## Links to discussion

* Mailing list discussion?
* Original GDocs document
